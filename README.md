## Overview

This repository includes three tasks: a To-Do List application, a simple Calculator, and a Password Generator. These tasks aim to demonstrate different aspects of Python programming, from GUI development to algorithm implementation.

## Tasks

### 1. To-Do List

#### Description

Create a To-Do List application that allows users to manage and organize their tasks efficiently. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for an intuitive user experience.

#### Features

- [x] Add tasks with a specified date
- [x] Delete tasks
- [x] Mark tasks as completed
- [x] View completed tasks separately
- [x] GUI-based interface

### 2. Calculator

#### Description

Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. The calculator performs the calculation and displays the result.

#### Features

- [x] Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- [x] User input for two numbers and operation
- [x] Display the result
- [x] Exception handling (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError and other exceptions)

### 3. Password Generator

#### Description

Implement a password generator application allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

#### Features

- [x] User input for password length
- [x] User input for password complexity
- [x] Complexity:
     - Weak - upper & lower case letters
     - Strong - upper & lower case letters + digits
     - Very Strong - upper & lower case letters + digits + special characters 
- [x] Generation of strong and random passwords
- [x] Display the generated password
- [x] GUI based interface

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. To run GUI applications install tkinter and tkcalendar
3. Run each Python script for the respective tasks (`todo_list.py`, `calculator.py`, `password_generator.py`).
4. Follow on-screen instructions for each task.

## Development
